## Overview

Geosetta is a platform for hosting subsurface investigation and historic geotechnical data from various publicly funded sources throughout the United States. As a non-profit Maryland-based organization, we offer subscription-based tools for geospatial visualization of historic geotechnical data, providing preliminary understanding of existing and anticipated subsurface conditions using machine learning techniques.

**Note:** Geosetta's data are NOT to be used as a substitute for site-specific investigations.

## üöÄ Features

### Interactive Map Interface
- **Browse Historic Data**: Access thousands of boring logs from DOTs across the United States
- **Real-time Search**: Find locations by address, latitude/longitude, zip code, or description
- **Layer Controls**: Toggle terrain elevation, geology layers, and karst data at appropriate zoom levels
- **Data Clustering**: Efficient visualization of large datasets with intelligent clustering

### Deliverable Types

#### üìç Points
- **Historic Locations**: View existing geotechnical data with options to:
  - Download PDF boring logs
  - View data in browser and download DIGGS XML files
  - Generate 3D point cloud models
  - Access USDA soil maps
  - View in RSLog format
  - Report data issues

- **User-Placed Points**: Generate predicted geotechnical data with:
  - Anticipated boring log predictions
  - Seismic site class predictions
  - Surface elevation calculations
  - Monthly precipitation history (NOAA)

#### üìè Lines
- Draw elevation profiles with:
  - Estimated depth to rock
  - Groundwater levels
  - Predicted blow count ranges
  - Export to Excel/CSV for CAD and slope stability analysis

#### üî≤ Polygons
- Select areas to:
  - Download all contained boring logs
  - Generate DIGGS files for multiple borings
  - Create fence diagrams
  - Export as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or KML
  - View in 3D
  - Generate subsurface statistics

### üåü New Features
- **MnDOT Integration**: Thousands of boring logs and CPT data from Minnesota DOT
- **Data Quality Tools**: Help improve accuracy by fixing GPS locations and reporting issues
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D point cloud models of subsurface conditions
- **CPT Data Support**: Comprehensive cone penetration testing data display

## üì° API Documentation

Geosetta offers a powerful API for sponsors to integrate our data into their systems. API access requires sponsorship.

### Available Endpoints

#### 1. Retrieve Historic Data in Radius
```python
import requests

api_key = "your_api_key_here"

json_payload = {
    "deliverableType": "Return_Historic_Data_In_Radius",
    "data": {
        "points": [{
            "latitude": 39.21884440935613,
            "longitude": -76.84346423232522,
            "radius_m": 1000
        }]
    }
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://geosetta.org/web_map/api_key/",
    json=json_payload,
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
)
```

#### 2. SPT Point Prediction
Generate subsurface predictions for up to 50 points per request (max depth: 100 feet).

```python
json_payload = {
    "deliverableType": "SPT_Point_Prediction",
    "data": {
        "points": [{
            "latitude": 39.387080,
            "longitude": -76.813480,
            "depth": 50,
            "surfaceelevation": None  # Optional
        }]
    }
}
```

#### 3. Project Visualization Link
Create a shareable link displaying your project data alongside Geosetta's historic data.

```python
json_payload = {
    "deliverableType": "Project_Link",
    "data": {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": [
            # Your GeoJSON features here
        ]
    }
}
```

#### 4. Distance from Trained Point
Check the distance to the nearest point used in our training dataset.

#### 5. PDF to DIGGS Conversion
Convert PDF boring logs to DIGGS XML format.

```python
with open(pdf_file_path, 'rb') as pdf_file:
    response = requests.post(
        "https://geosetta.org/web_map/api_key/",
        files={'file': pdf_file},
        data={'json_data': json.dumps(json_payload)},
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
    )
```
